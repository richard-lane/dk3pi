Test
====

Some of these are 'actual', automatable tests (`ut/`, `it/`).

`pull_study/` is the dir for the charm fitter's pull study

`bin_decays/` is for binning AmpGen generated decays into phase space + performing some quick fits, it isn't really a test

Uses anaconda python3 with `flaky` and `pytest` for some python tests
