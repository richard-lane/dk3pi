Efficiency
====

Particle detectors aren't perfect- each event has a certain probability
of being detected which is in general less than 1.
For this analysis (D -> K pi pi pi) we have 5-dimensional final state
phase space, so our efficiency will be a function over a 5d space.

We can estimate our efficiency from Monte Carlo data- it (presumably) reproduces
the detector quite well. However, it won't be possible to generate enough data
to find the efficiency directly from Monte Carlo- if we have 100 bins along each of
our 5 axes, that will be 10^10 bins which is far too many to find an efficiency value
in each one from data.

Instead, we have to do something clever...

Example
-------
An example script exists at `./scripts/toy_efficiency_example.cpp`

This script reads data from a D -> K3pi ROOT file (probably generated by AmpGen) to use as "truth-level" data.

It then applies an efficiency to it to find "MC" and "real" data.
These are two different datasets, but they are drawn from the same distribution.

It then uses the above methods to estimate the efficiency using the truth- and MC-level datasets.

Finally, it reweights the "real" data using these efficiencies, and creates plots of the original + reweighted distributions.
